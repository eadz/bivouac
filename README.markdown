#Bivouac: Where push == deploy

Bivouac is a Sintra application for hosting and deploying rack compliant web applications.

Bivouac works by creating a git repository for a given app name in a subdomain of the domain the web server is running under. This allows 'git push' to be the deployment mechanism.

Born on 17 May, 2009 at Railscamp 5 in the Gold Coast Hinterland of Queensland, Australia via a collaboration between Martin Stannard, Michael Koukoullis and Keith Pitty with valued assistance from Phil Oye, Myles Byrne and Tim Lucas.
